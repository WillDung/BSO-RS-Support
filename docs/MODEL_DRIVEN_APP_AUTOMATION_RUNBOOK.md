# Model-driven App and Sitemap Automation Runbook

**Status:** Phase 2B readiness update, 21 October 2026. No Power Platform resources were changed. Target is the verified VN LMV IT organization and the existing unmanaged Solution `os_sr_bso_rs_support`. Exact app unique name `os_sr_app` is blocked by the documented AppModule naming contract. Runtime behavior for the requested underscore-containing suffix is **UNKNOWN**. No test App may be created under this phase.

## Target

- App display name: **BSO-RS-Support**.
- Proposed final unique name: **os_sr_app**; exact publisher-prefix behavior is unresolved. Do not allow automatic double-prefixing.
- Solution: **os_sr_bso_rs_support**; Publisher: **os_bso_rs_support**, prefix **os**.
- Initial publication state: **Unpublished**.
- Initial table/navigation: `os_sr_ta` at **Recruitment Support > Administration > TA Directory**.
- Main form: existing **Information** form, type **main**.
- Initial default public view: **Active TA Directories**, query type `0`.
- Other tables, navigation, security-role associations, publication, and generated/Custom Pages are out of initial scope.

## Tool Capabilities

| Surface | Supported here | Limitation / guard |
|---|---|---|
| PAC CLI 2.13.1 | `pac model create`, `list`, `list-tables`; genpage management; Solution export | `model create` cannot set the app unique name. Omitting `--publish` is required for the unpublished shell. It cannot configure the Area/Group/entity SubArea in this initial command. |
| AppModule SDK/Web API | Create `appmodule` with name, unique name, description and default web resource; use `SolutionUniqueName` on supported Create request/header | Caller can supply `uniquename`, but publisher prefixing still applies. The required `sr_app` suffix conflicts with documented alphanumeric-only input; exact final-name creation is not supported/guaranteed, and runtime handling is UNKNOWN. No test App is authorized. |
| Model-driven app APIs | `AddAppComponents`, `RetrieveAppComponents`, `ValidateApp`, and `PublishXml` | Use typed components/IDs from read-only metadata. Add forms/views only after explicit selection. Validation and publication are separate. |
| AppModuleComponent metadata | Component type values include Entity `1`, View `26`, Form `60`, Sitemap `62` | Use supported app APIs/designer rather than directly creating internal app-module component rows. |
| Forms and views | Dataverse SDK CRUD on `systemform` and `savedquery`; AddAppComponents binds existing components to the app | Do not change approved TA layout/query metadata in this phase. Form XML and FetchXML are not required to add existing components. |
| Sitemap | Supported SiteMap XML component/record and AddAppComponents association; Power Apps app designer is also supported | Use designer-generated, schema-valid SiteMap XML as the source template. Genpage add/upload is for generated pages, not ordinary entity navigation. |
| Dataverse MCP | Current session supports metadata schema descriptions, selected metadata SQL reads, and Solution export via PAC | No dedicated model-driven app composition tool was exposed. The generic Custom API invoker is not a generic caller for every standard action. Metadata SQL did not successfully return TA systemform/savedquery records; export was used to inspect Solution metadata. |
| Official skills | `dv-connect`, `dv-metadata`, `dv-solution`, and `dv-security` are present in `.agents/skills` | `dv-metadata` covers schema/forms/views; `dv-solution` covers ALM; `dv-security` covers access. None provides a complete app shell + sitemap deployment workflow. |

## Read-only Preflight

Run these before any future write. Stop on any target mismatch; never switch environments.

```powershell
$org = 'https://org14938ec2.crm4.dynamics.com'
pac env who
pac solution list --environment $org
pac model list --environment $org
pac model list-tables --environment $org --type custom --search os_sr_ta,os_sr_pos,os_sr_csrc,os_sr_loc
```

The expected identity is VN LMV IT and the URL above. Verify Publisher prefix `os`, target Solution unique name/version/Publisher, the selected app name is not already present, and only expected project tables exist. Confirm TA form/view IDs and metadata with a read-only Dataverse SDK/Web API query or temporary PAC Solution export. Do not read table rows. Do not invoke the failed Position metadata operation.

For Solution membership, use PAC `solution list`, read-only `solutioncomponent` queries, `RetrieveAppComponents` for the app after it exists, and an export read-back. A TA table root component with `rootcomponentbehavior=0` includes its table subcomponents in the Solution; the app’s own component selection is separate.

## Naming Resolution

Installed command help:

```text
pac model create [--environment] --name [--description] [--solution] [--publish]
```

There is no `--unique-name` option. This command can associate the app with the Solution but cannot guarantee `os_sr_app`.

Microsoft's [AppModule creation guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/create-manage-model-driven-apps-using-code) states that the caller-supplied unique name uses English letters and numbers and that Dataverse automatically prepends the Solution Publisher prefix. The AppModule reference lists `uniquename` as a writable string of maximum length 100 but does not document a prefix bypass or underscore exception.

To produce final `os_sr_app` with prefix `os`, the supplied suffix would need to be `sr_app`, which contains an underscore and conflicts with the documented alphanumeric input rule. Supplying `os_sr_app` as the caller value to a prefix-aware create path risks `os_os_sr_app`. The docs do not establish a supported way for either SDK or Web API to suppress publisher-prefixing or independently force the final value. Exact runtime reject/transform behavior is **UNKNOWN**. The exact requested name is therefore not supported/guaranteed by the documented creation contract. Do not submit either value, create a temporary app, accept a transformed name, or automatically choose a replacement.

There is no safe executable AppModule payload for the requested exact name under the documented contract. The normal AppModule Create payload shape is not authorization to call it. Resolve the blocker by obtaining a Microsoft-documented supported naming exception or an explicit owner decision approving a revised technical name that satisfies the prefix and character rules. No app test or creation occurred in this phase.

Non-executable PAC shape for future review only (do not run while the approved exact name remains unresolved):

```powershell
pac model create `
  --environment 'https://org14938ec2.crm4.dynamics.com' `
  --name 'BSO-RS-Support' `
  --description 'Internal recruitment support application for authorized BSO candidate operations, backed by Dataverse.' `
  --solution 'os_sr_bso_rs_support'
```

Do not add `--publish`. Even without that switch, this command is **not authorized or ready to run** because it cannot guarantee the requested unique name. A future creation command must not be prepared as executable until the naming decision is resolved.

## App Composition Sequence

Every write step below is a future phase requiring its own explicit authorization. The automation should default to plan/read-only mode and require an explicit Apply switch plus typed confirmation for each authorized change batch.

1. **Resolve technical name before creation.** Current requested `os_sr_app` is not supported/guaranteed under the documented prefix-plus-alphanumeric contract. Obtain Microsoft documentation for an exception or explicit owner approval for a compliant replacement. No test app is permitted by this readiness task.
2. **Create unpublished AppModule only after naming approval.** Use PAC `model create` only if its generated technical name is approved; otherwise use supported AppModule Create with explicit `uniquename` and `SolutionUniqueName`. Omit publish and stop on any failure.
3. **Verify app identity and Solution.** Independently read the AppModule row and Solution component membership. Confirm exact display/unique names, Publisher, Solution, app state, and unpublished component state. Do not proceed on mismatch.
4. **Add TA table component.** Resolve the TA metadata ID with a GET and use `AddAppComponents` or app designer for the `os_sr_ta` table. Read back `RetrieveAppComponents`; access no table rows.
5. **Configure sitemap.** Add Recruitment Support > Administration > TA Directory using supported SiteMap/app APIs or app designer and read back. Generated-page commands do not create ordinary table SubAreas.
6. **Select UI components.** Add only the existing Main `Information` form and `Active TA Directories` public view after resolving current IDs and state. Do not change the form/view metadata.
7. **Validate.** Call `ValidateApp`, inspect the complete `ValidationIssueList`, and verify Solution/app component membership. Do not change role assignments.
8. **Remain unpublished.** Publication requires separate approval. Only then may scoped `PublishXml` be considered. Export for ALM read-back; do not alter Git.

## API Operation References

Use supported Microsoft actions and SDK request types; do not handcraft opaque internal app graph data:

- Create AppModule row: `POST /api/data/v9.2/appmodules`, with the `MSCRM.SolutionUniqueName` optional parameter.
- Add selected app components: `POST /api/data/v9.2/AddAppComponents` with `AppId` and typed `Components`; Microsoft examples include `savedquery` and `systemform`. The action documentation also lists sitemap, entity, dashboard, and business-process-flow components.
- Read app selection: `GET /api/data/v9.2/RetrieveAppComponents(AppModuleId=<GUID>)`.
- Validate: `GET /api/data/v9.2/ValidateApp(AppModuleId=<GUID>)`.
- Publish only after separate approval: `POST /api/data/v9.2/PublishXml` with only the target app ID in `<appmodules>`.

For standard forms/views, the `dv-metadata` skill documents `systemform` and `savedquery` SDK record CRUD. The app designer/API selection of those existing records is distinct from creating or editing them.

## Failure and Recovery

- Stop after the first failed or ambiguous write. Do not automatically retry.
- Read back AppModule, Solution membership, app component list, sitemap, and selected forms/views before proposing any follow-up.
- If an object exists but is incomplete, preserve it and report the partial state. No automatic delete, rename, recreate, or publish.
- No table creation, business-row access, security-role changes, audit changes, environment switch, or Git operation is part of this app phase.
- Keep the Phase 1D-D Position 401 separate. Its cause remains **UNKNOWN**; successful GETs or app creation do not resolve it. Do not retry Position.
